    <img src="images/Photoshop Warmup Art.jpg" </img> <h3>Intro to Photoshop, Photoshop, 2019</h3>
    <p>This piece was meant to be an exercise to prepare people on the basics of using Photoshop. In this exercise, we were given separate images and combine them into an inanimate being with the skills learned in Photoshop.</p>

    <img src="images/Jellyfish Exercise Art.jpg" </img> <h3>Distorting Jellyfish, Photoshop, 2019</h3>
    <p>This piece was an exercise to practice editing in Photoshop. We mixed different filters and distortions in the software and messed around with the contrast and color of the image.</p>

  <div class="portfolio-item">
    <img src="images/Glitch Art.jpg" </img> <h3>Hatsune Misfortu, Audio, 2019</h3>
    <p>This piece was my first attempt at distorting an image so that the image looks like it has a bug or “glitch” in the system while making the image. This piece gave me an opportunity to play around in an audio editing software and learn how to
      edit using sound waves.</p>

    <img src="images/Composite Art.jpg" </img> <h3>Closet of Memories, Photoshop, 2019</h3>
    <p>This piece was a collaborative effort with a group of others and our idea was to combine our three pieces to connect as though these subjects of our choosing were stored away in a place where they would never be seen nor used again like in a
      closet or a hardware. My piece was a mix of a couple different popular animes that have been stored away as if they were kept as memories.</p>

    <img src="images/Finger Emoji Art.jpg" </img> <h3>Pinky Finger, Photoshop, 2019</h3>
    <p>This piece was created to represent the making of current emojis in people’s media. I created a piece that resembled the same purpose as the finger emojis. I, instead, did the pinky finger sticking out because it means multiple purposes such
      as the etiquette of royalty drinking, or the swear finger in most asian cultures.</p>

    <h3>Unfortunate Life, Video, 2019</h3>
    <p>This piece was a video created of a story about this cup. It was unintentional at first, but as my partner and I took more and more photos, we found that this cup was in mostly all of our clips. When the video plays out, it tells a short
      preview of the adventure this cup has gone through before it meets its unfortunate demise.</p>
