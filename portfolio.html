    <h3>Unfortunate Life, Video, 2019</h3>
    <p>This piece was a video created of a story about this cup. It was unintentional at first, but as my partner and I took more and more photos, we found that this cup was in mostly all of our clips. When the video plays out, it tells a short preview of the adventure this cup has gone through before it meets its unfortunate demise.</p>

    <h3>Intro to Photoshop, Photoshop, 2019</h3>
    <p>This piece was meant to be an exercise to prepare people on the basics of using Photoshop. In this exercise, we were given separate images and combine them into an inanimate being with the skills learned in Photoshop.</p>
