    <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
    <p>I, Stephen Sum, have successfully achieved my goals in my creativity during the process of these art pieces. I am currently in a state where I am still finding more potential creativity the more I continue to make art. I plan to become a Digital Media Artist so I have lots of time on my hands to make more great and interesting art designs. I also love the creativity and fun of making these pieces. It is interesting learning how to edit, create, and make my own types of art when there have been so many other artworks out there that have such differenciality.
In my process of work, I tend to make a lot of uniquely different styles of art according to what I am assigned. I am not set minded on a single topic, I usually create what is on the top of my mind. When I work, I work at a pace where I like to thoroughly think out my plan and creativity. Although, this does make me tend to work a little over the limited time I have before I have to turn in my work, but in the end, I am proud of how my artwork comes out with the amount of effort I put into each piece. In the end, people see my artwork and are greeted with creativity that people enjoy.
